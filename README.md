### What is the Collaborative UI?

The Collaborative UI is a web application that interfaces with the microservices that comprise the ecosystem. It provides users a comprehensible experience to find and use different services of the platform, and has collaboration at its heart.

The Collaborative UI also uses a common library and framework that contains interfaces to services and styling called the desp-ui-fwk.
